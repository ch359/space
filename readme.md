#### Space game

Exploring Javascript, HTML5 canvas and Phaser

#### Features

- Ship that you can move about the screen
- Newtonian-ish ship movement (spin around backwards and accelerate to slow down)
- Bouncing from walls reduces velocity by 50% to avoid speed getting too high to control

#### Instructions for use

- Install `nodeJS` following instructions for your operating system
- Run `npm install` from the project root to install dependencies
- Run `npm run start` from the project root to start a server
- Navigate to a web page at 127.0.0.1:8000 to begin playing
- Left / right arrow keys rotate the ship
- Up arrow accelerates the ship in the direction of pointing
- To slow down, you'll need to rotate the ship and accelerate away from the direction of motion

#### Assets used
